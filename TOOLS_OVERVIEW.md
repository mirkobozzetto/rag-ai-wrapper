# Technical Stack Analysis for RAG Project

## Overview

This document provides technical analysis of each tool in our RAG stack, explaining the engineering decisions and implementation rationale.

---

## Package Manager: uv

### Technical Purpose

uv replaces pip/poetry for Python dependency management. It handles package installation, virtual environment creation, and dependency resolution with deterministic lock files.

### Engineering Benefits

- Performance: 10-100x faster than pip due to Rust implementation
- Dependency resolution: Uses SAT solver for conflict resolution
- Reproducibility: Automatic lock file generation with cryptographic hashes
- Compatibility: Drop-in replacement for pip with extended features
- Workspace support: Multi-project dependency management

### Implementation

```bash
# Core dependencies
uv add fastapi langchain qdrant-client fastembed

# Development tools
uv add --dev pytest black ruff mypy

# Execution
uv run python -m src.api.main
```

### Technical Decision

Chosen over pip for speed and deterministic builds, over poetry for simplicity and performance. Critical for CI/CD pipeline efficiency.

---

## Web Framework: FastAPI

### Technical Purpose

FastAPI provides the HTTP REST API layer for the RAG service. Handles request routing, data validation, serialization, and automatic API documentation generation.

### Engineering Benefits

- Performance: Built on Starlette/ASGI, comparable to Node.js/Go performance
- Async-first: Native asyncio support throughout the stack
- Type safety: Automatic validation via Pydantic integration
- Developer experience: Automatic OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Production ready: Built-in security, middleware support, dependency injection

### Implementation

```python
# RAG endpoints with type safety
@router.post("/query")
async def query_rag(request: QueryRequest) -> QueryResponse:
    return await rag_service.process_query(request)

# Server-sent events for streaming
@router.post("/stream")
async def stream_rag() -> StreamingResponse:
    return StreamingResponse(generate_stream())
```

### Technical Decision

Chosen over Flask for async support and automatic validation, over Django for lightweight API-focused architecture. Critical for handling concurrent RAG requests efficiently.

---

## RAG Framework: LangChain

### Technical Purpose

LangChain orchestrates the RAG pipeline: document retrieval, prompt construction, LLM invocation, and response processing. Provides abstractions for complex AI workflows.

### Engineering Benefits

- Composition: LCEL (LangChain Expression Language) for declarative pipeline definition
- Integration ecosystem: 400+ integrations with LLMs, vector stores, APIs
- Memory management: Conversation history and context window handling
- Streaming support: Real-time response generation with callbacks
- Error handling: Built-in retry logic and fallback mechanisms

### Implementation

```python
# Declarative RAG pipeline using LCEL
rag_chain = (
    RunnableParallel({
        "context": retriever | format_docs,
        "question": RunnablePassthrough()
    })
    | prompt_template
    | llm
    | StrOutputParser()
)
```

### Technical Decision

Chosen for rapid prototyping and extensive integrations. Alternative would be custom pipeline with more control but significantly more implementation overhead.

---

## Vector Database: Qdrant

### Technical Purpose

Qdrant stores and indexes high-dimensional vectors for semantic similarity search. Enables fast retrieval of relevant document chunks based on embedding similarity.

### Engineering Benefits

- Performance: Optimized HNSW indexing with sub-linear search complexity
- Scalability: Horizontal scaling with automatic sharding and replication
- Flexibility: Rich metadata support with payload filtering
- Memory optimization: Scalar quantization for reduced memory footprint
- API design: RESTful and gRPC interfaces with async support

### Implementation

```python
# Vector storage with metadata
await qdrant.upsert(
    collection_name="documents",
    points=[{
        "id": doc_id,
        "vector": embedding,
        "payload": {"source": filename, "chunk_id": i}
    }]
)

# Semantic search with filtering
results = await qdrant.search(
    collection_name="documents",
    query_vector=query_embedding,
    limit=5,
    score_threshold=0.7
)
```

### Technical Decision

Chosen for on-premise deployment capability, performance characteristics, and flexible metadata handling. Avoids vendor lock-in compared to cloud-only solutions.

---

## Embedding Generation: FastEmbed

### Technical Purpose

FastEmbed generates vector embeddings locally without external API dependencies. Converts text into numerical representations for semantic similarity computation.

### Engineering Benefits

- Local processing: No external API calls, reduced latency and costs
- Privacy: Text data never leaves the local environment
- Performance: Optimized batch processing with ONNX runtime
- Model variety: Access to state-of-the-art embedding models (BGE, E5)
- Consistency: Deterministic embedding generation

### Implementation

```python
# Model initialization
embedding_model = TextEmbedding(
    model_name="BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5",
    max_length=512
)

# Batch embedding generation
embeddings = list(embedding_model.embed(documents))
```

### Technical Decision

Chosen over OpenAI embeddings for cost control and data privacy. Local processing eliminates API rate limits and external dependencies.

---

## Data Validation: Pydantic

### Technical Purpose

Pydantic provides runtime data validation and serialization for API requests and responses. Ensures type safety and automatic schema generation.

### Engineering Benefits

- Type safety: Runtime validation with static type hints
- Performance: Rust-based core (v2) for high-throughput validation
- Schema generation: Automatic OpenAPI schema from Python types
- Serialization: Efficient JSON/dict conversion with custom encoders
- Integration: Native FastAPI support for automatic validation

### Implementation

```python
class QueryRequest(BaseModel):
    query: str = Field(..., min_length=1, max_length=1000)
    max_results: int = Field(default=5, ge=1, le=20)
    stream: bool = False

class QueryResponse(BaseModel):
    answer: str
    sources: List[SourceDocument]
    query_time: float
```

### Technical Decision

Chosen for FastAPI integration and performance. Provides both runtime safety and development-time IDE support.

## Testing Framework: Pytest

### Technical Purpose

Pytest manages test execution for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing. Validates system behavior and prevents regressions.

### Engineering Benefits

- Simplicity: Natural assertion syntax without boilerplate
- Fixture system: Reusable setup/teardown with dependency injection
- Plugin ecosystem: Coverage, mocking, parallel execution, async support
- Test discovery: Automatic test collection and execution
- Reporting: Detailed failure reports with context

### Implementation

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_rag_query():
    response = await rag_service.query("test question")
    assert response.answer is not None
    assert len(response.sources) > 0
```

### Technical Decision

Standard choice for Python testing due to simplicity and ecosystem maturity.

### Engineering Benefits Ruff

- Performance: 10-100x faster than flake8/pylint due to Rust implementation
- Comprehensive: Replaces multiple tools (flake8, isort, pyupgrade, etc.)
- Automatic fixes: Many rule violations can be auto-corrected

### Implementation

```bash
# Code formatting
uv run black src/ tests/

# Linting with automatic fixes
uv run ruff check --fix src/
```

### Technical Decision

Black chosen for consistency, Ruff for performance and comprehensive rule coverage.

## Type Checking: MyPy

### Technical Purpose

MyPy performs static type analysis to detect type inconsistencies before runtime. Enables gradual typing adoption.

### Engineering Benefits

- Early error detection: Type errors found before deployment
- IDE integration: Better autocomplete and refactoring support
- Documentation: Type hints serve as executable documentation
- Incremental adoption: Can be added gradually to existing codebases

### Implementation

```python
# Explicit type annotations
async def process_query(
    self,
    request: QueryRequest
) -> QueryResponse:
    ...
```

### Technical Decision

Essential for maintaining code quality in larger codebases and catching errors early.
